# Convolution-Calculator Version 1.0

## Description 
Convolution Calculator calculates the convolution of two discrete data sets. 
This program runs from the command line and takes three arguments: 2 Input .txt files
and 1 Output .txt file. Whatever you name the output text file is the name that will 
appear in the directory. The data sets need to be structured in columns within the text
file with x values in the first column and y values in the second column. Examples test files
are stored in the test-data folder. A statement will be printed in the terminal indicating to
the user that the convolution was successfully generated.

## Tools Used
